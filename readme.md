WoodCuts


This tool was created out of interest in maximizing the efficiency of board cuts while building a credenza and from curiosity in researching the problem and studying the <cuttingstock> problem.

The premise is that given a number of different lengths of wood that are to be cut, determine the most efficient cutting pattern to reduce the waste of predetermined lumber stock.

This application uses front-end javascript with angularjs and jquery libraries. The implementation of the solution utilizes the <xxx> algorithm to maximize stock efficiency.
